# Workroom

Workroom is a portable web application for accessing and managing
[Pace](https://github.com/waltster/Pace) instances. Workroom offers a visual way
to link your data sources, view their status, and generate insights from the
data.

Originating from the need to see multiple streaming inputs at once, Workroom
aims to offer robust semantic understanding to data that is disparate and
difficult to work with.

## Development

Workroom is currently in early development stage and is not feature-rich or
fully functional. Please be sure to check back at a later time.

## Usage
To view a development build of Workroom, run the following commands:
```sh
$ npm install # Installs dependencies
$ npm run dev # Launch development build
```
